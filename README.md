# Cloud-Change-Intelligence-Portal

The Cloud Change Intelligence Portal is an event‑driven, cost‑conscious system that captures and surfaces security‑relevant changes in your AWS environment. By leveraging native AWS services like CloudTrail, EventBridge, Lambda and S3, it generates an immutable feed of actions— enriched with context and risk scores— and publishes them as a static site.
